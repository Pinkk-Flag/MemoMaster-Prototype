### What is dynamics?

It is the study of the effect of motion on the what motion of objects.

### What is a force?

A force causes an object change its state of motion or transfers energy to be stored or used for movement. 

- It is measured in Newtons (N)
- The force has a direction, hence a vector force.

### Effect of forces

- Unbalanced forces cause objects to accelerate and do work (transfer their energy) on an object.
- Balanced forces cancel out. For example, if there are two magnitudes of the same energy from the opposite direction on one object, then it will not wove.

# Types of forces

- They are forces that can be classified into general groups:
    - Resistance forces: Forces which resist motion and only act when an object is moving.
    - Propulsion: forces which are produced by engines to push an object forward.
- Gravity exerts a force on all objects constantly
    - Weight of force
    - W = mg
    - W measured in Newtons
    - m: mass (kg)
    - g: gravity (m/s^2), which is approximately 9.8m/s^2 on Earth.
    

- Tips to keep in mind:
    - Make the magnitude of the arrows relevant. For example, if the applied force line is greater than the friction, then it means that it is accelerating.
    
- All the weight must be balanced on all objects that don’t fall vertically.
    - Norman force balances weight and is exerted by whichever object you are standing/resting on.
    - Normal = weight.
    
- Force diagrams show the forces acting on an object.
    - Object represented as a dot at the centre of mass.
    - Arrows start at the dot and point in the direction in which the object would move.
    - The size of the arrow show how large the force is.
    - It is labelled with name of force and magnitude.

# Netwon’s First Law

- An object remains at rest or in constant motion unless acted on by a net external force.
    - An object won’t change what it’s doing if all the forces are balanced.
    - The law is often referred referred to as: “the law of interia”.

Side effect: Inertia

- The tendency of an object to resist changes in motion.
- A larger unbalanced force is needed to change a heavier objects motion.
