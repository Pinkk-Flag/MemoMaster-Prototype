It is a simple tool that allows the user to convert their already existing notes into flashcards to streamline their workflow to allow more time learning, less time spent on making flashcards. 

# How to install and use
1. Ensure that you have the dependencies installed (Python, cohere).
2. Set up an environment to run the project. Alternatively, you may wish to make this into an `.exe` file by using pyinstaller.
3. Insert your notes inside the text.txt file in the directory. Ensure that it is only on ONE topic at a time. Inputting too much (over ~1000 words) or too many subjects may reduce the efficiency in which the flashcards are created by the Cohere AI.
4. Insert your Cohere API in the main.py file. You can get a FREE Api at [cohere.com].
5. (Optional steps from now on) Change temperature, condition, maximum tokens, model, etc to your liking to best suit your notes and needs. 

# What does it do?
The MemoMaster (prototype) is an application that removes the friction between creating flashcards for yourself and learning. Creating flashcards is a laborious and tiresome process, and this tool will help stop this, and give you more time on your hands. It gets text input of your notes or coursework, and then converts them into clean, and bite-sized flashcards for personal use. Works great with complementary software such as Quizlet, Anki, etc to use those flashcards. 

# Future plans
* Thinking of improving this in the future by adding a GUI interface with parsing of more versatile file types such as PDF's, PNG's, TXT, etc to make it further more seamless, as well as including an Anki extension.
